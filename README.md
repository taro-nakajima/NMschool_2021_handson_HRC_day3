# Hands-on experiments at HRC(BL12), NM school 2021, Day 3

## Sec.1: Introduction of the DAVE software
## Sec.2: constant-E and constant-Q cuts

### Problem 1
Draw Q-E (L-E) maps of CsVCl<sub>3</sub> measured with E<sub>i</sub>=102 meV and E<sub>i</sub>=15.3 meV.
* Download (or clone) this repository and load the script "CsVCl3_contour_plot_script.txt" in gnuplot.

### Problem 2
* Draw const-E cuts of the data measured with E<sub>i</sub>=102 meV.
    * Open "CsVCl3_constE_script.txt" by a text editor.
    * Set values for "IntegE_min" and "IntegE_max", which are the minimum and maximum energies for integration with respect to E.
    * Load the script in gnuplot, and then a png file showing the const-E profile and a txt datafile of the profile.
